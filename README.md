# code-snippets
A collection of my useful code snippets

The motivations for maintaining this are:
* Have a collection of small toy examples that I can reuse in other projects before I forget them
* Never forget those *tricks* in *that* language
* Solve basic puzzles/problems and improve them over time when I find a better solution

All files will be *.org* and will follow [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) paradigm.
