** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz][Fizzbuzz]]

Slightly modified the problem to use =-3= instead of =Fizz= and =-5= instead of Buzz. Reason is wanted to do this
via list comprehensions in haskell which are type homogenous.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell :exports both
  let fizzBuzz :: [Int] -> [Int]
  let fizzBuzz inputList = [if x `mod` 3 == 0 then -3 else if x `mod` 5 == 0 then -5 else x | x <- inputList]
  fizzBuzz [1..10] -- try it out
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Prelude> [1,2,-3,4,-5,-3,7,8,-3,-5]
